# Algorithmic management in knowledge-intensive firms

## Research problem

"I need somebody with a human touch" (Spice Girls, 1997)

Algorithms have played an important part in everyday life for millenniums, for example, the world's oldest known recipe is four thousand years old (Barjamovic et al., 2019). Algorithm as a concept was formalized by Al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2025). With the introduction of Scientific Management by Fredric Taylor in 1910, labor tasks became rationalized with analogue algorithms. With the introduction of computers in the mid 20th century, algorithms became digitalized. During World War II, with the introduction of Management Science and Operations Research, algorithms became specialized for management tasks.

In the last decades, with the growth of network infrastructure and increase in compute resources, algorithms have become more present in organizations. With research in data structures and algorithms, they are starting to assist in almost all management tasks that are traditionally performed by humans, such as increasing self-awareness, get feedback, set goals, set priorities, coaching, empowerment, delegation, motivation, conflict resolution, selling, strategy making, marketing, support, project-planning, monitoring, recruitment, retention, training, mentoring, ethics, and morality. If this evolution continues without research, reflection, and constructive criticism, it can lead to the scenario that we get managers without the human touch.

Although management is primarily a functional process, it does serve a social process. As such, management cannot be entirely outsourced to computer-mediated technology, yet neither can it remain completely outside of algorithmic development. Management decisions can be categorized as deterministic or non-deterministic, and based on individualistic or community preferences, with a whole spectrum of possible positions between the extremes:

    Type D: [0.9, 0.3]
    Type E: [0.4, 0.3]
    Type F: [0.3, 0.9]
```

Similar to the problem of social cost (Coase, 2013), the problem of management cost is also about social arrangements. Coase (2013) advocates considering the total effect when analyzing social arrangements. Similarly, in creating and choosing between management arrangements we should have regard for the total effect. Avoid suboptimization and use an opportunity cost approach.

## State of the art

Milanez et al. (2025) did a survey of algorithmic management in the workplace, and highlights the need for additional research to ensure trustworthy use of it. The authors suggest five focus areas for further research. First, there is a need to understand the mechanisms by which algorithmic management tools improve managerial decision-making. Second, what impact does algorithmic management have on individual contributors. Third, how does each type of algorithmic management tool influence outcomes and trustworthiness. Fourth, how do the outcomes vary with time since adoption. Fifth, what are the governance measures to consider.

Macias et al. (2023) identified two main types of algorithmic management currently in use: algorithmic direction and algorithmic evaluation. At the European level, there is a shortage of research which examines the pervasiveness and impacts on working conditions, of digital monitoring and surveillance in the regular and platform economies (Macias et al., 2023).

Ball (2021) evaluated literature on electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace, and recommends future research on topics related to algorithmic management:

* The development of high trust employee monitoring practices
* Technical and practical ways in which employees can gain autonomy over data collection and
sharing and the impact on performance and efficiency

From private conversations over the years, it is clear that not all software engineers want to become managers. Modig (2023) did a well-attended presentation about the desire of staying as a developer in your entire career. Given there is a need for the management role, and not everyone wants to pursue it, to which extend can it be automated with algorithms?

## Questions/hypotheses

"And all that I can see is just another lemon tree" (Fool's Garden)

The central question to analyze is how to benefit from algorithmic management in terms of total productivity, without making people just see "another lemon tree", that is, without reducing their trust and motivation in their workplace.

Specifically, these questions are relevant:

* How can algorithms encourage managers to reward sound decision making, instead of rewarding results? That is, how can it encourage employees to focus on processes and not results?
* What are the implications of being in the different positions in the algorithmic management quadrants? The focus is not on finding an optimal position, but understanding the implications for leaders and contributors of being in the different positions.
    * Which management tasks and responsibilities should be deterministic, and which should be non-deterministic?
    * How do algorithms affect the human computational cost of interacting with each other? That is, do they simplify or problematize the contact between management and individual contributors?
    * How is trust and authority built, maintained or eroded with algorithmic management
    * How does algorithmic management affect emotions and efficiency on the long-term and short-term
    * What are the signaling costs when using algorithmic management

## Research design

* Data driven
    * Analyze efficiency over time
* Evaluate software development efficiency
    * Data Envelopment Analysis
        * Code commits
        * Issues resolved per sprint
        * Number of employees in team
    * Together with AHP/ANP
        * Team goal
        * Decide on criteria
        * Use criteria to evaluate task priority
* Model team organization as a continuous optimization problem of match quality
    * Business requirements and candidates continuously change
    * Members can rotate and leave at arbitrary times
    * Link it with DEA
* Interview people randomly in large numbers and ask them who they think the most efficient professionals are

## Method

Different perspectives to look at this problem:

* As a change management issue
* Compare with history how similar changes were received


* Use opportunity cost approach for different algorithm situations

The PhD will use qualititative research methods to follow the development and application of algorithmic management in the tech sector in Sweden. The aim is to

* Triangulation on the same set of research questions
    * Data triangulation
    * Investigator triangulation
    * Theory triangulation
    * Methodological triangulation
* To avoid confirmation bias, it is important to be open to information that allows for disconfirmation
* Use analogical reasoning to reduce bias (Bazerman and Moore, 2017)
* Model beat plan as assignment problem to optimise resource use, while considering learning objectives
* If applied on organization level, workforce assignment with cross-training defined could optimize task assignment
* Investigate how small changes in behavior can drastically change the performance, such as saying good morning in a friendly voice
* Sort out causality by using instrumental variables regression - vacation times for example affect volume of work but not otherwise affect outcomes
