# Local cloud computing - competitive advantage

## Research problem

Understand why local cloud infrastructure providers find it difficult to compete against larger providers.

Suspected behavioral symptoms:

* Information asymmetry - customers know much more about their environment than cloud providers
* Sunk cost - customers have already invested heavily in on-prem solutions or existing infrastructure

## Questions/hypotheses

* What would make them competitive
* What blocks customers from choosing them
* What drives customer behavior
* What makes customers decide to have their own infra team

## Research design

* Compare with history, starting with supercomputers, to desktop machines, to laptops, and then back to cloud
* Analyze environmental impact, what makes most sense from a global perspective to run such a business

## Theory/literature

## Method

* Porter's five forces analysis
