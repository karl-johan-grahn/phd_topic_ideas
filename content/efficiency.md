# Software development team constellation efficiency

## Research problem

In software development companies, teams are often organized based on business needs and subjective impressions, rather than on objective measurements and research findings. Team organization is important because it affects individual performance, team performance, organizational performance, and industry performance. The guidelines that exist for team formation are often passed along through folklore rather than being based on scientific research.

With a focus on software development, the goal of the research is to create an economic model for efficient team organization, which can later be generalized to other industries.

The model should be flexible with respect to goals. Use linear programming, and emphasize that goals can be arbitrary.

Efficiency should be flexible to define, for example by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).

## Questions/hypotheses

* Group efficiency: Optimal number of people in software development teams in terms of economic productivity
* Which erformance-based incentives are relevant for engineers
* What is the optimal team size with respect to experience and career goals
* What is the role of managers, if everyone is skilled enough
* How to use DEA to measure software development output
* Learning curve application for onboarding new software developers (how introduction material and onboarding will help developer quickly get up to speed compared to getting nothing at all, who needs intro, how much, how to deliver it to lowest cost, etc.)
* Develop pool of organizational successors - tool to help evaluate the extent of the organisations' pending shortage, needed competencies, identify individuals for possible inclusion in pool, establish individually tailored development programs for high-potential candidates, select and place people into senior jobs based on their performance, continuously monitor the program

## Research design

* Data driven
    * Analyze efficiency over time
* Evaluate software development efficiency
    * Data Envelopment Analysis
        * Code commits
        * Issues resolved per sprint
        * Number of employees in team
    * Together with AHP/ANP
        * Team goal
        * Decide on criteria
        * Use criteria to evaluate task priority
* Interview people randomly in large numbers and ask them who they think the most efficient professionals are

## Theory/literature

## Method

* Model beat plan as assignment problem to optimise resource use, while considering learning objectives
* If applied on organization level, workforce assignment with cross-training defined could optimize task assignment
* Investigate how small changes in behavior can drastically change the performance, such as saying good morning in a friendly voice
