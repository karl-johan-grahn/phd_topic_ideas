Algorithm as a concept was formalized by Al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2025). With the introduction of Scientific Management (Taylor, 1911), labor tasks became rationalized with analogue algorithms. With the introduction of computers in the mid 20th century, algorithms became digitalized. During World War II, with the introduction of Management Science and Operations Research, algorithms became specialized for management tasks.</p> <p>In the last decades, with the growth of network infrastructure and increase in compute resources, algorithms have become more present in organizations. With research in data structures and algorithms, they are starting to assist in almost all management tasks that are traditionally performed by humans, such as increasing self-awareness, get feedback, set goals, set priorities, coaching, empowerment, delegation, motivation, conflict resolution, selling, strategy making, marketing, support, project-planning, monitoring, recruitment, retention, training, mentoring, ethics, and morality. If this evolution continues without research, reflection, and constructive criticism, it can lead to the scenario that we get managers without the human touch.</p> <p>Although management is primarily a functional process, it does serve a social process. From personal experience of working in knowledge-intensive firms over the past 20 years, it has always served a critical social role. As such, management cannot be entirely outsourced to computer-mediated technology, yet neither can it remain completely outside of algorithmic development. Management decisions can be categorized as deterministic or non-deterministic, and based on individualistic or community preferences, with a whole spectrum of possible positions between the extremes:</p> <pre><code>quadrantChart\n    title Management decision styles\n    x-axis Non-deterministic --&gt; Deterministic\n    y-axis Individualistic --&gt; Group-influenced\n    quadrant-1 Institutional\n    quadrant-2 Team consensus\n    quadrant-3 Humanistic subjective\n    quadrant-4 Rational\n    Type A: [0.03, 0.6]\n    Type B: [0.4, 0.2]\n    Type C: [0.5, 0.6]\n    Type D: [0.9, 0.3]\n    Type E: [0.4, 0.3]\n    Type F: [0.3, 0.9]</code></pre> <p>Similar to the problem of social cost (Coase, 2013), the problem of management cost is also about social arrangements. Coase (2013) advocates considering the total effect when analyzing social arrangements. Similarly, in creating and choosing between management arrangements we should have regard for the total effect. Avoid suboptimization and use an opportunity cost approach.</p>"},{"location":"algorithmic_management.html#state-of-the-art","title":"State of the art","text":"<p>Milanez et al. (2025) did a survey of algorithmic management in the workplace, and highlights the need for additional research to ensure trustworthy use of it. The authors suggest five focus areas for further research. First, there is a need to understand the mechanisms by which algorithmic management tools improve managerial decision-making. Second, what impact does algorithmic management have on individual contributors. Third, how does each type of algorithmic management tool influence outcomes and trustworthiness. Fourth, how do the outcomes vary over time since they have been adoption. Fifth, what are the governance measures to consider.</p> <p>Macias et al. (2023) identified two main types of algorithmic management currently in use: algorithmic direction and algorithmic evaluation. At the European level, there is a shortage of research which examines the pervasiveness and impacts on working conditions, of digital monitoring and surveillance in the regular and platform economies.</p> <p>Ball (2021) evaluated literature on electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace, and recommends future research on topics related to algorithmic management:</p> <ul> <li>The development of high trust employee monitoring practices</li> <li>Technical and practical ways in which employees can gain autonomy over data collection and sharing and the impact on performance and efficiency</li> </ul> <p>From private conversations over the years, it is clear that not all software engineers want to become managers.

Services are operated, maintained, and managed by site reliability engineers. Site reliability engineering has the goal to maintain high availability and reliability of services provided over inherently unstable and unreliable networks. Software as such also has errors. When providing defective services over faulty networks, failures and emergencies will happen when services are deployed and used. This research is focused on how to respond to emergencies.</p> <p>Software development is done in a highly technical environment and it is easy to fall into the trap of treating people as technological components. Employees can easily become treated as disposable units where management often lacks insight or compassion for their short-term and long-term professional efficiency and mental health. Revenue depends on the number of users of the system, so mental health of employees becomes secondary goal, while technical health of computer systems becomes primary goal. Stress related mental illness is a recurring issue across many workplaces (Johansson, 2025, Ploeg &amp; Kleber, 2003).</p> <p>Companies usually lack processes for effective emergency response. Emergency response becomes crisis situations where people work without coordination and efficiency. Few engineers know how to act, because the situation is chaotic, unstructured, and urgent, while they have more often been trained in calm, relaxed environments, on structured problems. The few who are brave enough to respond, learn the process the hard way. Folklore for emergency response arise and form the basis for how to do emergency response in the industry, while processes should rather be developed in a structured manner through science.</p> <p>Processes are usually implemented silo-wise with little knowledge sharing between organizations or industries.</p> <p>A software emergency can be classified purely as a technical issue, but depending on the software and how it is used, it can have far-spread implications. Impact, severity, and frequency are the typical dimensions to categorize an emergency.</p> <p>The research will analyze how managers should build environments to sustain personal efficiency and health when dealing with emergency response in software services. The focus is on cost-analysis from a behavioral economic lens, how emergency response affects context-switching on personal level, team level, organizational level, company level. The research should compare emergency response in other industries, since many other professionals are in similar situations, such as medical doctors, fire-fighters, police-personnel, and military.</p> <p>The hypothesis is that the repetitive pressure to perform in emergency situations has detrimental effects on short-term mental health.</p> <p>Focus will be on behaviors because emergency response is not a technical issue, it is a people management issue. Understanding human behavior is important for optimizing organizational decisions such as setting up emergency response schedules, understanding the optimal balance between development work versus monitoring work, how to lead emergency response, how to take responsibility.</p> <p>This research will be relevant for the next 10-15 years because over the past decade, the SaaS market has seen a compound annual growth rate of 25% (Deloitte, 2021), and with growth comes higher expectations on strict uptime SLAs, which requires swift emergency response.</p>"},{"location":"emergency_response.html#questionshypotheses","title":"Questions/hypotheses","text":"<ul> <li>How is the brain activity different in emergency response versus regular mode</li> <li>How can the brain activity during an emergency be compared to other states of the mind</li> <li>What long-term and short-term impact does emergency response have on efficiency and health of individuals</li> <li>When and how can it be positive to be in a state of emergency response</li> <li>Which professions and cultures are considered to be most prepared for emergency response<ul> <li>How does the Japanese school system prepare citizens for emergency response</li> </ul> </li> <li>Which processes are considered the most effective when dealing with emergencies</li> <li>How to apply a learning curve application for cost-efficient onboarding of emergency commanders</li> <li>How to train managers to understand and assess emotional reactions during and after emergencies</li> <li>How can simulation models help in root cause analysis</li> <li>How does context-switching from emergency response affect short-term and long-term performance</li> <li>Is the context-switching cost different for unplanned emergencies and planned work</li> <li>How to keep people motivated to be in a sustained sense of awareness for prolonged time, except for bonus payment</li> <li>Is root cause analysis about preventing future mistakes, or about learning what happened, compare with Allspaw (2012)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"emergency_response.html#research-design","title":"Research design","text":"<ul> <li>Acquire qualitative data to understand processes, and quantitative data to understand correlation</li> <li>How to form causality?</li> <li>Qualitative data to understand processes, way of working, way of preparing yourself, handling feelings<ul> <li>Do cross-comparison of emergency response across industries by interviewing medical doctors, fire fighters, police personnel, nuclear plant personnel</li> <li>What is unique for each role</li> <li>What is similar for all roles</li> </ul> </li> <li>Quantitative data to understand how the brain manages emergency response<ul> <li>Brain activity measurements with EEG<ul> <li>Control group: Perform activities similar to regular work<ul> <li>With preparation instructions</li> <li>Without preparation instructions</li> </ul> </li> <li>Experiment group: Introduce surprise task to imitate an emergency<ul> <li>With preparation instructions - imitate that training has been done</li> <li>Without preparation instructions - imitate a new case</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Heart-rate measurements</li> <li>Participants: Students to retired</li> </ul> </li> <li>Longitudinal study of health and performance impact</li> </ul>"},{"location":"emergency_response.html#theoryliterature","title":"Theory/literature","text":"<ul> <li>Chun, M., &amp; Most, S.
